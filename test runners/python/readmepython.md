## Testing  

The test runner can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ju9KLfuFQNeb8W9DJ1eU8q5BWSk0aKlv/view?usp=sharing).  

### Instructions  

1. Place the test runner file in the root directory.  
2. In the same directory, create a folder that will contain all the scripts and the test file. The folder can have any name (e.g., `src`).  
3. Inside this folder, ensure the following files are present:  
   - A `test.py` file that contains the actual tests you wrote, with the import statement:  
     ```python
     from solution import *
     ```
   - Multiple files containing base code, ideal code, incorrect code, and code generated by models 1-10.  
   - **Do not name any file `solution.py`.**  

4. Run the tests using the following commands:  

   ```sh
   $ python script.py src           # Provides a summary test log in the report
   $ python script.py src --verbose # Provides a complete test log in the report
   ```

5. After running the script, test reports for each file will be available in the `src/test_reports` folder.  
6. Ensure that all required packages are installed before running the test runner script.  

### Sample Folder Structure:  

```
root/  
├─ script.py  
├─ src/  
│  ├─ modelA.py  
│  ├─ modelB.py  
│  ├─ modelC.py  
│  ├─ incorrect_response.py  
│  ├─ ideal_response.py  
│  ├─ tests.py  
```
